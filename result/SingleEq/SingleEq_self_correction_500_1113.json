Let's review the problem and provide the correct answer:\n\nWe are told that Alyssa gave 7 puppies to her friends and now she has 5 puppies left. Let's represent the number of puppies she initially had as x.\n\nAfter giving away 7 puppies, Alyssa is left with (x - 7) puppies. And we know that this quantity is equal to 5. So we can set up the equation:\n\nx - 7 = 5\n\nTo solve for x, we can add 7 to both sides of the equation:\n\nx - 7 + 7 = 5 + 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 12\n\nTherefore, Alyssa initially had \\boxed{12} puppies."}]]}, {"question": "There were a total of 10 soccer games in the season.

Let's solve the problem correctly this time.\n\nSam received 9 pennies for washing clothes. Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, the value of the pennies Sam received is $\\frac{9}{100}$ dollars.\n\nSam also received 7 quarters for mowing lawns. As each quarter is worth $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a dollar, the value of the quarters Sam received is $7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}$ dollars.\n\nTo find the total amount of money Sam has, we add the values of the pennies and the quarters:\n\n$\\frac{9}{100} + \\frac{7}{4} = \\frac{9}{100} + \\frac{175}{100} = \\frac{9+175}{100} = \\frac{184}{100}.$\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we have:\n\n$\\frac{184}{100} = \\frac{92}{50} = \\frac{46}{25}.$\n\nTherefore, Sam has $\\frac{46}{25}$ dollars.\n\nHence, the final answer, rounded to two decimal places, is $\\boxed{1.84}$."}]]}, {"question": "Nancy, Melanie, Mary, and Alyssa each bought 540 baseball cards,  which come in packs of 20.
