So, we have the equation: n(n-1)/2 - (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can multiply through by 2: n(n-1) - (n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\nExpanding and combining like terms, we get: n^2 - n - n^2 + 3n - 2n + 2 = 90.\n\nSimplifying further, we have: n - 2 = 90.\n\nFinally, isolating n, we find that n = 92.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the value of n, not n-2. So, we subtract 2 from 92 to get the final answer:\n\nn = 92 - 2 = 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 10.```\n\n One agent solution: ```To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. The total number of ways to choose 2 balls from n balls is given by the formula C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2. \n\nHowever, we need to subtract the number of ways that include the ball with number 3 marked on it. Since we are excluding the ball with number 3, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 balls from a set of n-1 balls. This is given by the formula C(n-1, 2) = (n-1)(n-2)/2. \n\nNow, we can set up an equation to solve for n. \nC(n, 2) - C(n-1, 2) = 45 \nn(n-1)/2 - (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45 \n(n^2 - n - n^2 + 3n - 2)/2 = 45 \n2n - 2 = 90 \n2n = 92 \nn = 46 \n\nTherefore, the value of n is 46.\n\nAnswer: (X) There is no answer choice provided for 46 which means this question may not have been formatted correctly.

In this case, we have n = 5 (as five registered voters are chosen at random) and p = 0.9 (as there is a 90% probability that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election).\n\nWe want to find the probability that exactly four of the five chosen voters voted in the last election, so k = 4.\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula, we can calculate the required probability:\n\nP(4 successes) = (5 choose 4) * 0.9^4 * (1 - 0.9)^(5 - 4)\n              = 5 * 0.9^4 * 0.1^1\n              = 0.32805.\n\nRounding this to the nearest tenth, we get 0.3, which is approximately 32.8%.\n\nTherefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five chosen voters voted in the last election is (B) 32.8%.```\n\n Using the reasoning from other agents as additional advice, can you give an updated answer?

The main line train starts at 5 o'clock with a frequency of 10 minutes. This means that the first main line train arrives at 5 o'clock, the second at 5:10, the third at 5:20, and so on.\n\n2. The harbor line train starts at 5:02 A.M. with a frequency of 10 minutes. Hence, the first harbor line train arrives at 5:02 A.M., the second at 5:12, the third at 5:22, and so on.\n\n3. The man arrives at the station every day to catch the first train that comes. In order to calculate the probability of him catching the first train, we need to determine the time interval during which he can catch it.\n\n4. The main line train starts at 5 o'clock, while the harbor line train starts 2 minutes later at 5:02 A.M. This means that the man has a 2-minute window to catch the first train.\n\n5. Since the frequency of both the main line and the harbor line trains is 10 minutes, a train arrives every 10 minutes on both lines. Thus, for the man to catch the first train, it should arrive within his 2-minute window.\n\n6. The probability of the first train arriving within this window can be calculated by dividing the length of the window (2 minutes) by the frequency of the trains (10 minutes).\n\nProbability = Window length / Frequency\nProbability = 2 / 10\nProbability = 0.2\n\nTherefore, the updated probability of the man catching the first train is 0.2 (B) according to the correct reasoning.\n\nUpdated answer: (B) 0.2"}]]}, {"question": "At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800\n", "answer": "E", "agent_contexts": [[{"role": "user", "content": "Can you answer the following question as accurately as possible?

This means that the angle of elevation changes by 15° (60° - 45°) in 10 minutes.\n\nNow, we can set up a proportion:\n\n(Change in distance traveled)/(Change in angle of elevation) = (Total distance traveled)/(Total change in angle of elevation)\n\nLet x be the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. \n\n(Change in distance traveled) / (15°) = (d(√3))/(10 minutes + x minutes)\n\nSimplifying the proportion:\n\n(10 minutes + x minutes)(Change in distance traveled) = (15°)(d√3)\n\n(10 minutes + x minutes)(d(√3 + 1) - d) = (15°)(d√3)\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n10d√3 = 15°d√3 + 15°dx + 10d - dx\n\n5d√3 = dx + 10d\n\nFactor out d:\n\n5√3 = x + 10\n\nx = 5√3 - 10\n\nTherefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after an additional time of 5√3 - 10 minutes.\n\nAnswer: (C) 7(√3 – 1)```\n\n One agent solution: ```To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. Let's assume that the height of the tower is h, and the distance covered by the car is d.\n\nFrom the given information, when the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, the height of the tower increases by h*(60°-45°) = h*(15°). We can use the tangent function to find this increase:\n\ntan(15°) = h*(15°) / d\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nh*(15°) = d*tan(15°)\n\nNow, using the sine function, we can relate the height of the tower to the distance covered by the car:\n\nsin(60°) = h / d\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nh = d*sin(60°)\n\nSubstituting this value of h in the earlier equation, we get:\n\nd*sin(60°) = d*tan(15°)\n\nCanceling out the d term from both sides, we get:\n\nsin(60°) = tan(15°)\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nsin(60°) = sin(15°) / cos(15°)\n\nSince the sines of both angles are equal, we can conclude that the cosines of the angles must also be equal:\n\ncos(15°) = cos(60°)\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity cos(x) = sin(90° - x), we can further simplify the equation:\n\ncos(15°) = sin(90° - 60°)\n\ncos(15°) = sin(30°)\n\nNow, using the trigonometric identity sin(30°) = 1/2, we can solve for cos(15°):\n\ncos(15°) = 1/2\n\nWe can then use this value of cos(15°) to find the ratio of the sides in a 45-45-90 triangle:\n\ncos(15°) = x / (√2 * x)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n1/2 = 1 / √2\n\nMultiplying both sides by √2, we get:\n\n√2 / 2 = 1\n\nThis is true, so we have found a valid solution.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that the car will reach the base of the tower after the additional time required for the angle of elevation to change from 60° to 75°. Since the angle changes by 15° in 10 minutes, it will take an additional 10 minutes for the angle to change by another 15°. Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after 20 minutes in total.\n\nThe answer is: None of these (E)```\n\n Using the reasoning from other agents as additional advice, can you give an updated answer?

Substituting F = 3S into J + S + F = 100, we get J + S + 3S = 100, which simplifies to J + 4S = 100.\n\nWe need to find a solution where J, S, and F are positive integers such that J + S + F = 100. The only possible solution for this is J = 20, S = 20, and F = 60.\n\nTherefore, the age of Joe's father is 60.  (A)```\n\n One agent solution: ```Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that J + S + F = 100. (Equation 1)\n\nWe are also given that Joe's sister will be twice as old when Joe is as old as his father. This can be written as:\nS + (F - J) = 2S\nF - J = S\n\nFurthermore, we are told that when Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This can be written as:\nJ + (F - J) = 2(S - F)\nJ - F = S - 2F\n\nNow, we have three equations as follows:\nJ + S + F = 100 (Equation 1)\nF - J = S (Equation 2)\nJ - F = S - 2F (Equation 3)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the age of Joe's father. \nFrom Equation 2, we get F = S + J\nSubstituting this into Equation 1: J + S + (S + J) = 100\n2J + 2S = 100\nJ + S = 50\n\nSubtracting Equation 2 from Equation 3: J - F - (S - J) = S - 2F\n2J - S = 3F\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of J + S from Equation 1 into the above equation:\n2(50 - S) - S = 3F\n100 - 2S - S = 3F\n100 - 3S = 3F\nDivide both sides by 3: 33.333 - S = F\n\nSince the age of a person is an integer, the age of Joe's father can be 33 or 34 when S = 0. However, this isn't possible as Joe's father should be older than both Joe and his sister.\n\nSo, if we assume that Joe's sister's age is 1, then Joe's age is 48 (as J + S = 50). Substituting these values into Equation 2: F - 48 = 1, F = 49.\n\nTherefore, the age of Joe's father is 49.

This means that the length of the yard must be the sum of the fenced sides plus the unfenced side: L = 2W + 10.\n\nWe can substitute this value of L into our area equation: (2W + 10) * W = 240.\n\nExpanding the equation, we get: 2W^2 + 10W = 240.\n\nRearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation, we get: 2W^2 + 10W - 240 = 0.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can either factorize or use the quadratic formula. Factoring is not straightforward, so let's use the quadratic formula:\n\nW = (-10 ± √(10^2 - 4 * 2 * -240)) / (2 * 2).\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: W = (-10 ± √(100 + 1920)) / 4.\n\nW = (-10 ± √2020) / 4.\n\nW = (-10 ± 20√5) / 4.\n\nW = (-5 ± 10√5) / 2.\n\nSince the width cannot be negative, we can ignore the negative value. Therefore, W = (-5 + 10√5) / 2.\n\nApproximately, W ≈ 3.09.\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into our equation for L: L = 2(3.09) + 10.\n\nL ≈ 16.18.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the rectangular yard, which represents the amount of fencing Alice needs, we can add up the lengths of all sides except the unfenced side:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + W + 10 = 2(16.18) + 3.09 + 10 ≈ 45.45 + 3.09 + 10 ≈ 58.54.\n\nTherefore, Alice needs approximately 58.54 meters of fencing. The answer rounded to the nearest whole number is 58. So, the answer is (A) 58.```\n\n One agent solution: ```Let's assume that the length of the rectangular yard is x meters and the width is y meters. Since she wants to leave one side of 10 meters unfenced, the length of the unfenced side is 10 meters.\n\nWe know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula length × width. So, we have that xy = 240.\n\nWe also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her yard. This means she needs to fence the two sides with lengths x and y, as well as the side with length 10 meters. Since there are three sides fenced, the total length of fencing needed is x + y + 10 meters.\n\nWe can solve for x in the equation xy = 240, by expressing y in terms of x. Dividing both sides of the equation by x, we get y = 240/x.\n\nSubstituting this expression for y into the total length of fencing needed, we have x + y + 10 = x + 240/x + 10 = (x^2 + 10x + 240)/x.\n\nTo find the value of x, we need to solve the equation x^2 + 10x + 240 = 0. Factoring this quadratic equation, we have (x + 24)(x - 10) = 0. So, x = -24 or x = 10.\n\nSince the length of a yard cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, x = 10.\n\nSubstituting this value of x into the total length of fencing needed, we have 10 + y + 10 = 20 + y.\n\nWe need to find the value of y to determine the length of fencing needed. From the equation xy = 240, substituting x = 10, we have 10y = 240. Solving for y, we find y = 24.\n\nSubstituting y = 24 into the total length of fencing needed, we have 20 + 24 = 44 meters.\n\nTherefore, Alice needs 44 meters of fencing in total. The answer is (X) none of the above.```\n\n Using the reasoning from other agents as additional advice, can you give an updated answer? Examine your solution and that other agents step by step. Put your answer in the form (X) at the end of your response."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Upon reviewing the solutions provided by other agents, I have noticed that there are discrepancies in their calculations and ultimate conclusions.\n\nThe first agent's solution correctly sets up the necessary equations to calculate the width and length of the rectangular yard. However, there is an error when simplifying the expression for the total fencing needed. Instead of obtaining the expression (4√30 - 6) meters, the agent incorrectly arrives at 16 meters. Therefore, the answer choice (A) 58, which is close to (4√30 - 6), is not supported by this solution.\n\nThe second agent's solution correctly establishes the equations for the length and width of the rectangular yard. However, there is an error when calculating the length of the unfenced side. Instead of obtaining 10 meters as the length of the unfenced side, the agent mistakenly concludes that it is also x. Consequently, the total length of fencing needed, calculated as x + y + 10, is incorrect. As a result, the answer choice of none of the above, which implies that the correct answer is not provided, is not accurate.\n\nAfter evaluating these solutions and revisiting the problem, the accurate solution is as follows:\n\nLet's assume the length of the rectangular yard is L meters and the width is W meters.\nWe know that the area of the yard is LW = 240.\n\nWe are given that Alice wants to fence three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means the length of the yard must be the sum of the fenced sides plus the unfenced side: L = 2W + 10.\n\nSubstituting the value of L from the second equation into the first equation, we get (2W + 10)W = 240.\n\nExpanding and rearranging the equation, we have 2W² + 10W - 240 = 0.\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring, we have (2W - 20)(W + 12) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we find that W = 20/2 or W = -12, so W = 10 or W = -12.\n\nSince the width of a yard cannot be negative, we discard the solution W = -12. Therefore, W = 10.\n\nSubstituting this value of W back into the equation L = 2W + 10, we get L = 2(10) + 10 = 30.\n\nThe total length of fencing needed is then 2L + W + 10 = 2(30) + 10 + 10 = 60 + 21 = 81 meters.\n\nTherefore, Alice needs 81 meters of fencing. The answer is (X) none of the above.\n\nMy revised solution deviates from the other agents' conclusions, as I have identified errors in their calculations."}]]}, {"question": "In the coordinate plane, a triangle has vertices at (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y).

However, they use this information to set up the equation 0.25x = 10 to find the number of men, which is incorrect. The 25% represents the ratio of men who preferred green cars, but it does not represent the percentage of men surveyed. This approach leads to an incorrect calculation of the total number of people surveyed.\n\nSolution 2:\nThis agent correctly finds that 10 men preferred green cars more than red, and they attempt to calculate the number of men who preferred red cars using the 75% figure. However, they mistakenly multiply 10 by 4 to find the number of men who preferred red cars, which is incorrect. This approach also leads to an incorrect calculation of the total number of people surveyed.\n\nAfter examining the other solutions, it is clear that the correct approach is to use the information given in the question, which is that 10 men liked green cars more than red. \n\nLet's reason through the question again:\n\nWe are given that 10 men preferred green cars more than red. This means that the remaining men, who are not part of this group, preferred red cars. Therefore, the total number of men who preferred red cars is 10 men.\n\nWe also know that 75% of the men preferred red cars. If 10 men represent 75%, then we can find the total number of men surveyed by setting up the equation 0.75x = 10, where x represents the total number of men. Solving for x, we get x = 10 / 0.75 = 13.33.\n\nSince the number of people surveyed must be a whole number, the closest option is (B) 120. So, 120 people took the survey.

Since one edge of the square cloth is trimmed by 4 feet, the length of the rectangular piece is the remaining side length of the square, which is also the same as the width of the rectangular piece. \n\nLet's suppose the side length of the square cloth is \"x\". After being trimmed, the length of the rectangular piece is \"x - 4\" feet, and the width is also \"x - 4\" feet.\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is ½ * base * height. Since the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half to form two triangles, we can find the area of one of the triangles by using the formula: ½ * (x - 4) * (x - 4) = 70.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we have (x - 4)^2 = 140.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have x - 4 = sqrt(140).\n\nAdding 4 to both sides, we have x = sqrt(140) + 4.\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the perimeter of the original square cloth. The perimeter of a square is given by the formula 4 * side length. Therefore, the perimeter of the original square cloth is 4x = 4(sqrt(140) + 4).\n\nCalculating the approximate value, we get the perimeter ≈ 4(11.83 + 4) ≈ 4(15.83) ≈ 63.32.\n\nThe closest whole number perimeter given in the answer choices is 64, so the answer is (E) 64.```\n\n Using the reasoning from other agents as additional advice, can you give an updated answer?

After trimming 4 feet on one edge, the rectangular piece will have side lengths $(s-4)$ feet and $s$ feet.\n\nSince the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half to form two triangles, the area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet, which leads us to the equation:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}(s-4)(s) = 70$\n\nSimplifying the equation gives $s^2 - 4s = 140$\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we need to factor or use the quadratic formula.

Therefore, 340 is divisible by 20.\n\nLet's substitute x = 0 into the equation to see if it satisfies the equation:\n\n20(0) + 25y = 340\n0 + 25y = 340\n25y = 340\ny = 340/25\ny = 13.6\n\nSince y should be a whole number representing the number of brass coins, we can conclude that x cannot be 0.\n\nNext, let's try x = 1:\n\n20(1) + 25y = 340\n20 + 25y = 340\n25y = 340 - 20\n25y = 320\ny = 320/25\ny = 12.8\n\nAgain, y must be a whole number, so x = 1 is not a solution.\n\nNow, let's try x = 2:\n\n20(2) + 25y = 340\n40 + 25y = 340\n25y = 340 - 40\n25y = 300\ny = 300/25\ny = 12\n\nFinally, let's try x = 3:\n\n20(3) + 25y = 340\n60 + 25y = 340\n25y = 340 - 60\n25y = 280\ny = 280/25\ny = 11.2\n\nSince y must be a whole number, x = 3 is not a solution.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 2. (C)```\n\n One agent solution: ```Let's assume the coin-diver brought X number of copper coins. Then, the total value from the copper coins would be 20X cents.\nSince she brought some brass coins as well, let's assume she brought Y number of brass coins. The total value from the brass coins would be 25Y cents.\nGiven that the total value after one dive is $3.40, we can write the equation:\n20X + 25Y = 340 (converting $3.40 to cents)\nDividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get:\n4X + 5Y = 68\nWe need to find the minimum number of copper coins brought, which means we want to minimize X. To minimize X, we need to maximize Y. One way to maximize Y is to make it as large as possible while still satisfying the equation.\nIf we let Y = 13, then 5Y = 65, and 4X = 68 - 65 = 3. Therefore, the minimum value of X is 1.\nSo, the minimum number of copper coins brought is (D) 1.```\n\n Using the reasoning from other agents as additional advice, can you give an updated answer?

We assume that the coin-diver brought X copper coins and Y brass coins.\n2. The total amount of money received for the copper coins is 20X cents, and for the brass coins is 25Y cents.\n3. The total value received after one dive is $3.40, which is equivalent to 340 cents.\n4. Setting up the equation 20X + 25Y = 340, we aim to find the minimum value of X.\n5. Dividing both sides of the equation by 5 to simplify it, we get 4X + 5Y = 68.\n6. To minimize X, we need to maximize Y. By letting Y = 13, we can substitute it into the equation.\n7. Solving for X, we find that 4X = 68 - 5(13) = 68 - 65 = 3. Therefore, X must be 1 to satisfy the equation.\n8. However, it is important to note that the solution X = 1 only considers the minimum value for X. We need to check if there are any other valid solutions.\n9. By trying X = 2, the equation becomes 4X + 5Y = 76.\n10. Substituting Y = 13, we find that 4X = 76 - 5(13) = 76 - 65 = 11. Therefore, X can also be 2 to satisfy the equation.\n11. At this point, we have found multiple valid solutions: X = 1 and X = 2. To identify the minimum number of copper coins brought, we choose the smaller value, which is X = 2.\n12.

Since the total filling rate per hour for the two hoses combined is 1 unit (as we assumed), in those 3 hours the two hoses filled 3 units.\n\nTherefore, the pool has a total capacity of 2 + 3 = 5 units.\n\nNow, to find out how many hours it would have taken hose B to fill the entire pool alone, we need to determine the rate at which hose B fills the pool.\n\nSince hose A and hose B together have a combined filling rate of 1 unit per hour, and hose A fills 1 unit per hour, the filling rate of hose B alone must be 1 - 1 = 0 units per hour.\n\nTherefore, it would take an infinite amount of time for hose B to fill the entire pool alone.\n\nAnswer: (A) 8"}, {"role": "user", "content": "These are the solutions to the problem from other agents: \n\n One agent solution: ```Let's assume that hose A's rate is a gallons per hour and hose B's rate is b gallons per hour. \n\nGiven that hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, we can say that hose A's rate is 1 pool per 8 hours, or (1/8) pools per hour. \n\nIn the first 2 hours, hose A fills (1/8) * 2 = 1/4 of the pool. \n\nThen, the remaining fraction of the pool that needs to be filled is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. This remaining fraction is filled by both hoses working together in 3 hours. \n\nSince we know that the combined rate of both hoses is 3/4 pool in 3 hours, we can set up the equation: (3/4) = (a + b) * 3. \n\nSimplifying, we get: (a + b) = 1/4. \n\nSince hose A alone can fill the pool in 8 hours or (1/8) pools per hour, we know that a = 1/8. \n\nSubstituting the value of a into the equation, we get: (1/8 + b) = 1/4. \n\nSimplifying, we get: b = 1/4 - 1/8 = 1/8. \n\nSo, hose B's rate is 1/8 pools per hour. \n\nTo find the time it would take hose B to fill the entire pool alone, we can set up the equation: (1/8) = b * t. \n\nSubstituting the known value of b, we get: (1/8) = (1/8) * t. \n\nSimplifying, we get: t = 8 hours. \n\nTherefore, it would take hose B, working alone, 8 hours to fill the entire pool. \n\nAnswer: (A) 8.```\n\n One agent solution: ```Let's assume that the rate at which hose A can fill the pool is \"a\", and the rate at which hose B can fill the pool is \"b\". \n\nWe know that hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour.\n\nIn the first 2 hours, hose A fills 2/8 (1/4) of the pool alone. So, we subtract this amount from the total pool volume to find out how much is left to be filled: 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nIn the next 3 hours, both hoses A and B working together fill the remaining 3/4 of the pool. The combined rate of hoses A and B is 1/8 + b.\n\nUsing the formula rate * time = volume, we can write the equation for the second part as (1/8 + b) * 3 = 3/4.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 3/8 + 3b = 3/4.\nMultiplying all terms by 8 to eliminate fractions gives us: 3 + 24b = 6.\nSubtracting 3 from both sides gives us: 24b = 3.\nDividing both sides by 24 gives us: b = 3/24 = 1/8.\n\nTherefore, hose B can fill the entire pool in 8 hours.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) 8.```\n\n Using the reasoning from other agents as additional advice, can you give an updated answer?

This means she will have a rest stop after every 15 km, except for the last stop when she reaches 100 km.\n\nTo calculate the total resting time, we need to find out how many times Shweta will have a rest stop. Since she covers 15 km per rest stop, we divide 100 km by 15 km to get 6.67. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a rest stop, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Shweta will have a total of 7 rest stops.\n\nEach rest stop lasts for 10 minutes, so the total resting time is 7 rest stops * 10 minutes per rest stop = 70 minutes.\n\nTo convert minutes to hours, we divide 70 minutes by 60 minutes per hour, which equals 1.17 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for Shweta to cover 100 km is 10 hours (travel time) + 1.17 hours (resting time) = 11.17 hours.\n\nThe answer is (C) 11 hours.```\n\n Using the reasoning from other agents as additional advice, can you give an updated answer?

In this case, we need to find the optimal number of trousers that can be purchased. Setting up the equation x / (810 - 70x)/30, we can solve for x.
