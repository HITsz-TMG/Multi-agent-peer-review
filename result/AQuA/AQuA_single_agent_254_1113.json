We can use the tangent function to find this increase:\n\ntan(15°) = h*(15°) / d\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nh*(15°) = d*tan(15°)\n\nNow, using the sine function, we can relate the height of the tower to the distance covered by the car:\n\nsin(60°) = h / d\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nh = d*sin(60°)\n\nSubstituting this value of h in the earlier equation, we get:\n\nd*sin(60°) = d*tan(15°)\n\nCanceling out the d term from both sides, we get:\n\nsin(60°) = tan(15°)\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nsin(60°) = sin(15°) / cos(15°)\n\nSince the sines of both angles are equal, we can conclude that the cosines of the angles must also be equal:\n\ncos(15°) = cos(60°)\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity cos(x) = sin(90° - x), we can further simplify the equation:\n\ncos(15°) = sin(90° - 60°)\n\ncos(15°) = sin(30°)\n\nNow, using the trigonometric identity sin(30°) = 1/2, we can solve for cos(15°):\n\ncos(15°) = 1/2\n\nWe can then use this value of cos(15°) to find the ratio of the sides in a 45-45-90 triangle:\n\ncos(15°) = x / (√2 * x)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n1/2 = 1 / √2\n\nMultiplying both sides by √2, we get:\n\n√2 / 2 = 1\n\nThis is true, so we have found a valid solution.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that the car will reach the base of the tower after the additional time required for the angle of elevation to change from 60° to 75°.

However, this isn't possible as Joe's father should be older than both Joe and his sister.\n\nSo, if we assume that Joe's sister's age is 1, then Joe's age is 48 (as J + S = 50).

Similarly, for each brass coin, the diver receives 25 cents, so the total amount of money received for the brass coins would be 25y cents.\n\nSince the diver received $3.40 in total, we can write this as an equation:\n\n20x + 25y = 340\n\nTo find the minimum number of copper coins brought, we need to find the smallest possible value of x.\n\nFrom the equation above, we know that 20 divides the left side evenly, so it must also divide the right side evenly. In other words, 340 must be divisible by 20.\n\nChecking the divisibility, we find that 340 ÷ 20 = 17. Therefore, 340 is divisible by 20.\n\nLet's substitute x = 0 into the equation to see if it satisfies the equation:\n\n20(0) + 25y = 340\n0 + 25y = 340\n25y = 340\ny = 340/25\ny = 13.6\n\nSince y should be a whole number representing the number of brass coins, we can conclude that x cannot be 0.\n\nNext, let's try x = 1:\n\n20(1) + 25y = 340\n20 + 25y = 340\n25y = 340 - 20\n25y = 320\ny = 320/25\ny = 12.8\n\nAgain, y must be a whole number, so x = 1 is not a solution.\n\nNow, let's try x = 2:\n\n20(2) + 25y = 340\n40 + 25y = 340\n25y = 340 - 40\n25y = 300\ny = 300/25\ny = 12\n\nFinally, let's try x = 3:\n\n20(3) + 25y = 340\n60 + 25y = 340\n25y = 340 - 60\n25y = 280\ny = 280/25\ny = 11.2\n\nSince y must be a whole number, x = 3 is not a solution.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 2.

We can do this by finding the cost per call. \n\nUsing the information given, when 540 calls were consumed, the bill was Rs.1800. This means that the cost per call is 1800/540 = Rs. 3.33 per call.\n\nNow, let's find the fixed component. We can do this by subtracting the variable component from the total bill when the highest number of calls was consumed.\n\nUsing the information given, when 620 calls were consumed, the bill was Rs.2040.
